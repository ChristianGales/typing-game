    "Northern Samar Colleges, Formerly Northern Samar Academy, located along Annunciaion corner Roxas Street, Brgy. J.P. Rizal, Catarman, Northern Samar, was established in 1949 and incorporated in 1950 in response to the clamor for a school that could meet the needs of a particular segment of the town populace. At the time, there were only two schools in town; one was a private Roman Catholic highschool; another, a public agricultural school About three kilometers away from the town proper across the river. There was no bridge then connecting the town to the road going that way and it was accessible only by banca. Public buses were scarce and tricyles and pedicabs were non-existent by then. A student from town had to hike the distance after crossing the river.",

    "Too meet the need for an alternative school that was more affordable and accessible, concerned citizens in the town proper incorporated themselves to put up the Northern Samar Colleges, Inc. offering highschool and so-called then inverted education courses to met the need for qualified public school teachers. Shortly after, the education courses were phased out and the school was named Northern Samar Academy offering only highschool and some short-term vocational courses such as tailoring, dressmaking, cosmetology, etc. which voacational courses were grdually phased out. The highschool program was the main thrust of the school until its 50th anniversary which ended the corporate life of NSA.",
